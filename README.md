# Frontline Agent
Never “open DevTools, hunt errors” again. Your agent does it while you keep coding.

## Overview
Today’s coding agents can write code and run back-end tests, but front-end development still requires humans to open the browser, read console or network errors, and relay them back. Frontline closes the gap by providing agents with live browser context, fully closing the loop on agent-driven development.

## Getting Started
In terminal, ```bash git clone https://github.com/zmzlois/browser-thing``` to copy the repo.  
Then `cd browser-thing` to navigate to the folder.  
`bunx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`
`npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`

## Architecture & Tech Stack

* Language, frameworks, Libraries/SDKs/APIs used
* Tools/Infra (e.g. deployment, agents, LLMs):

## Challenges
* What was hard
* What didn’t work initially
* Any tradeoffs or decisions

## What's Next
* Traces can be formatted and displayed to the end user instead of in the command line for improved transparency & visibility. For instance, a PM can track the changes being made and question the reasoning or decisions, so the trace becomes a collaboration layer, not just a backend log.
* Could create a CLI install package/tool to take care of necessary dependencies like Playwright
* Support on browsers like Safari, Edge, Firefox
