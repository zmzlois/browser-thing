# Stagehand Project

This is a project that uses Stagehand, which amplifies Playwright with `act`, `extract`, and `observe` added to the Page class.

`Stagehand` is a class that provides config, a `StagehandPage` object via `stagehand.page`, and a `StagehandContext` object via `stagehand.context`.

`Page` is a class that extends the Playwright `Page` class and adds `act`, `extract`, and `observe` methods.
`Context` is a class that extends the Playwright `BrowserContext` class.

Use the following rules to write code for this project.

- To take an action on the page like "click the sign in button", use Stagehand `act` like this:

```typescript
await page.act("Click the sign in button");
```

- To plan an instruction before taking an action, use Stagehand `observe` to get the action to execute.

```typescript
const [action] = await page.observe("Click the sign in button");
```

- The result of `observe` is an array of `ObserveResult` objects that can directly be used as params for `act` like this:

  ```typescript
  const [action] = await page.observe("Click the sign in button");
  await page.act(action);
  ```

- When writing code that needs to extract data from the page, use Stagehand `extract`. Explicitly pass the following params by default:

```typescript
const { someValue } = await page.extract({
  instruction: the instruction to execute,
  schema: z.object({
    someValue: z.string(),
  }), // The schema to extract
});
```

## Initialize

```typescript
import { Stagehand } from "@browserbasehq/stagehand";
import StagehandConfig from "./stagehand.config";

const stagehand = new Stagehand(StagehandConfig);
await stagehand.init();

const page = stagehand.page; // Playwright Page with act, extract, and observe methods
const context = stagehand.context; // Playwright BrowserContext
```

## Act

You can cache the results of `observe` and use them as params for `act` like this:

```typescript
const instruction = "Click the sign in button";
const cachedAction = await getCache(instruction);

if (cachedAction) {
  await page.act(cachedAction);
} else {
  try {
    const results = await page.observe(instruction);
    await setCache(instruction, results);
    await page.act(results[0]);
  } catch (error) {
    await page.act(instruction); // If the action is not cached, execute the instruction directly
  }
}
```

Be sure to cache the results of `observe` and use them as params for `act` to avoid unexpected DOM changes. Using `act` without caching will result in more unpredictable behavior.

Act `action` should be as atomic and specific as possible, i.e. "Click the sign in button" or "Type 'hello' into the search input".
AVOID actions that are more than one step, i.e. "Order me pizza" or "Type in the search bar and hit enter".

## Extract

If you are writing code that needs to extract data from the page, use Stagehand `extract`.

```typescript
const signInButtonText = await page.extract("extract the sign in button text");
```

You can also pass in params like an output schema in Zod, and a flag to use text extraction:

```typescript
const data = await page.extract({
  instruction: "extract the sign in button text",
  schema: z.object({
    text: z.string(),
  }),
});
```

`schema` is a Zod schema that describes the data you want to extract. To extract an array, make sure to pass in a single object that contains the array, as follows:

```typescript
const data = await page.extract({
  instruction: "extract the text inside all buttons",
  schema: z.object({
    text: z.array(z.string()),
  }),
  useTextExtract: true, // Set true for larger-scale extractions (multiple paragraphs), or set false for small extractions (name, birthday, etc)
});
```

## Agent

Use the `agent` method to automonously execute larger tasks like "Get the stock price of NVDA"

```typescript
// Navigate to a website
await stagehand.page.goto("https://www.google.com");

const agent = stagehand.agent({
  // You can use either OpenAI or Anthropic
  provider: "openai",
  // The model to use (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219 or claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620 for Anthropic)
  model: "computer-use-preview",

  // Customize the system prompt
  instructions: `You are a helpful assistant that can use a web browser.
	Do not ask follow up questions, the user will trust your judgement.`,

  // Customize the API key
  options: {
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  },
});

// Execute the agent
await agent.execute(
  "Apply for a library card at the San Francisco Public Library"
);
```
